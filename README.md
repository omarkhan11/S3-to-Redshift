Data Warehouse ETL Pipeline
Project Overview
This project is designed to build an efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that transfers data from AWS S3 into Redshift for analytics. The data consists of song and user activity logs, which are then processed, transformed, and loaded into Redshift to generate a set of dimensional tables for advanced analytics.

Key Components:
Source: Data stored in AWS S3 in JSON format.
Destination: AWS Redshift, where the data will be loaded into staging and dimensional tables.
Technologies Used: Python, AWS S3, AWS Redshift, SQL
The pipeline performs the following key operations:

Extract data from S3 (song and user activity logs).
Load the data into staging tables in Redshift.
Transform the data into analytics-ready dimensional tables.
Files in the Repository
etl_pipeline.py: The main Python script responsible for executing the ETL process, including:

Connecting to Redshift
Dropping and creating tables
Loading data into Redshift staging tables
Transforming the data and loading it into final analytics tables
sql_queries.py: A Python module that stores all the SQL queries for:

Dropping existing tables
Creating staging and analytics tables
Inserting transformed data into the final tables
dwh.cfg: A configuration file where you store your AWS and Redshift credentials needed to run the pipeline.

README.md: Documentation providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage.

Requirements
Before running the pipeline, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

Python 3.x
psycopg2 and configparser Python libraries for PostgreSQL (Redshift uses PostgreSQL).
To install the necessary libraries, run the following command:

bash
Copy
pip install psycopg2-binary configparser
Setting Up
1. AWS Credentials
Ensure you have the appropriate IAM role or user credentials that allow access to both S3 and Redshift. Configure the necessary credentials in the dwh.cfg file under the [CLUSTER] section.

Example:

ini
Copy
[CLUSTER]
HOST=<REDSHIFT_CLUSTER_ENDPOINT>
DBNAME=<DATABASE_NAME>
USER=<REDSHIFT_USERNAME>
PASSWORD=<REDSHIFT_PASSWORD>
PORT=<REDSHIFT_PORT>
2. Redshift Configuration
In the dwh.cfg file, configure the details to connect to your Redshift cluster, such as:

host: Redshift cluster endpoint
dbname: The name of your Redshift database
user: Your Redshift username
password: Your Redshift password
port: Default Redshift port (typically 5439)
3. S3 Bucket Configuration
Ensure that your S3 bucket contains the required song and user activity log data files, and that they are in JSON format. The pipeline will extract data from these S3 buckets and load it into Redshift for further processing.

Running the Pipeline
Once the setup is complete, you can run the ETL pipeline by executing the following command:

bash
Copy
python etl_pipeline.py
Pipeline Execution Flow
The ETL pipeline will perform the following operations:

Drop Existing Tables:

Drops any pre-existing tables in Redshift to ensure a fresh start.
Create New Tables:

Creates the staging tables for storing raw data from S3.
Creates the analytics (dimensional) tables for processed data.
Copy Data from S3 into Staging Tables:

The raw data from S3 will be copied into temporary staging tables in Redshift.
Insert Transformed Data into Final Analytics Tables:

The raw data from the staging tables will be transformed and loaded into the analytics tables for further analysis.
Structure of the Data Warehouse
The Redshift data warehouse is structured as follows:

Staging Tables:
These tables temporarily store the raw data extracted from S3:

staging_events: Stores raw user activity logs (event data).
staging_songs: Stores raw song data.
Analytics Tables:
These are the final dimensional tables used for analytics:

songplay: A fact table that stores information about song plays.
user: A dimension table that stores information about users.
song: A dimension table that stores information about songs.
artist: A dimension table that stores information about artists.
time: A dimension table storing time-related data (e.g., song play times).
Project Workflow
1. Drop Tables
Before starting the ETL process, the pipeline drops any existing tables in Redshift to start with a clean slate.

2. Create Tables
The script creates the necessary staging and analytics tables based on the SQL queries defined in sql_queries.py.

3. Copy Data from S3
Data is copied from S3 into Redshift staging tables using the COPY command. Ensure that your Redshift cluster has the required IAM roles to access the S3 buckets.

4. Transform and Insert Data
The script processes and transforms the data from the staging tables into the final dimensional tables by executing the appropriate SQL queries.

Notes
IAM Permissions: Ensure that the Redshift cluster has the appropriate IAM role or policy to allow access to your S3 bucket.
Data Format: The pipeline assumes that the raw data stored in S3 is in JSON format and is structured correctly for processing.
Modularity: The pipeline is designed to be modular, allowing you to easily add more transformations or modify existing ones.
Conclusion
This ETL pipeline efficiently processes raw data from AWS S3 into Redshift, transforming it into analytics-ready dimensional tables. It serves as a foundational framework that can be customized or extended based on specific analytics needs.
